## Possible sections

- Least squares regression on OU process
- Hypothesis test on fit (even need this to continue)
- Maximum likelihood estimation
- MLE vs Regression

# Notes

Did least squares regression, doesn't really seem like a good fit,
will have to calculate the error. Do that tomorrow.

**Before doing MLE, try and actually use the model, do MLE as an addition**
