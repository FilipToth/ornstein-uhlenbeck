## Possible sections

- Least squares regression on OU process
- Hypothesis test on fit (even need this to continue)
- Maximum likelihood estimation
- MLE vs Regression

- Do I need multiple OLS regression for optimizing OU process?
- In the "Augmented Dickey Fuller Test" section, maybe explain why we are accounting for autocorrelation with
  \beta \Delta y*{t - 1} instead of taking the value directly as: \beta y*{t - 1}, why the delta?

# Notes

Did least squares regression, doesn't really seem like a good fit,
will have to calculate the error. Do that tomorrow.

**Before doing MLE, try and actually use the model, do MLE as an addition**
